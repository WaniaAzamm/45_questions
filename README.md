I finished 45 assignments on GitHub for TypeScript and Node.js. My teachers helped me understand tricky stuff. I learned about making programs run smoothly, using TypeScript's helpful typing, and how Node.js can build big apps. Each assignment made me better at coding and thinking. They weren't just tasks; they were steps toward getting really good at making cool stuff with computers.
